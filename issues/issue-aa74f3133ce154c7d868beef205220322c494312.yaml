title: confusion reigns when switching between ditz issue directories
desc: |-
  Given two ditz issue directories, dir1 and dir2:
  1. Run ditz-todo for dir1.
  2. Move to an issue line and press enter to run ditz-show.
  3. Run ditz-todo for dir2. PROBLEM: You get the todo list for dir1 instead.
  4. Kill the todo buffer. Run ditz-todo for dir2 again.
  5. Move to an issue line and press enter to run ditz-show. PROBLEM: "no issue with name ..." error.
  
  Basically ditz.el seems to remember what directory each buffer was created from. Instead of paying attention to new information (an explicitly provided directory name, or the ditz-todo buffer from which ditz-show was called), it just keeps working w
  ith the original directory until the buffer is killed.
